# Lintol Open Data Coding Challenge

In this prototype we researched the application and finding of regular expressions sourced from the internet for text analysis that will produce the required schema by inferring presence of PII through text patterns.

This codebase demonstrates an extensivle and regactorable collection of pattern checks which, with more time, could be refined for greater accurace and coverage of cases.

To test this solution against the provided data sets execute the following commands through a command-line-interface:

```sh
# install package depencencies
npm install

# execute script
node index.js
```

The implementation of a refined comand line interface was not considered for this challenge, to allow for focus on the compostion of a broadening array of verification componens.

## Dependencies
